    <h1>Phu Minh Nguyen's Profile</h1>
    <p>1.	Personal information:
My name is Phu Minh Nguyen with ID is s3802460 and email address is s3802460@rmit.edu.vn. For some information about my background, first of all, I’m a Vietnamese. I was born in 7th November 2000, so I just turned to 19 recently. 	I can speak 3 languages including Vietnamese, English and Japanese. I did learn French before but not so good with it. During my primary school, I studied in Tan Dong Hiep public school. During my secondary, I studied in America International school. I completed grade 10 in Asia Internation school but I graduated and got my high school degree at Green River Community College in the U.S. I went back to Vietnam and studied in RMIT. This is my third class and my second semester in RMIT. 

My hobbies changed a lot through times. Back then, I was in to sport a lot. I learnt martial art, soccer, tennis, swim, etc. but then I quit because I didn’t have time for them since I focused in studying. I love science specifically in zoology, space, and physic. I usually research about them when I have time. Other than that, I also like reading novels, manga, watching movies and playing games. I always want to have pet in my house but I can’t because my mom hates animals.

    <p>2.	Interest in IT:
My interest in IT is game programming. I always love game, but back when I was young I didn’t have any chance to try and played any game that I like especially pokemon since I grew up with it. Then, when I studied in the U.S. I saved money and bought nintedo with pokemon games with it and I really enjoyed it. From there, I played more especially in MMORPG games since I love exploring and adventure. Games give me a lot of experience with some funny, sad, bored and even some insane moment due to the story telling. Also before that, I already wanted to be a programmer since I also love technology and technology works because of those programme that was coded by the programmer which make me fascinated about it. 

I choose to study in RMIT because it’s the closest university I can choose to achieve my passion to become a game programmer. Also, I like the facility and the way they teach as international teaching method. And there’s a lot of events I want to join but because it takes me normally roughly 2 hours to come so I missed a lot of events. 

I expect to learn how to code, the way how a programmer think and become success in game programming field. I know that in order to become a better at programming, I need to learn more than what I can learn in RMIT so I also need to prepare and study by myself.</p>
